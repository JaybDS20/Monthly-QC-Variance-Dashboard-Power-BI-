# Monthly QC Variance Dashboard 

# Overview
- This project involves the extraction, cleaning, and transformation of data to create meaningful insights and visualizations. 
- Using Power BI, the project aimed to present key performance data in an accessible and actionable format for non-technical stakeholders. 
- The process includes extracting data from relevant sources, handling data quality issues, building a data model with relationships, and performing custom calculations using 
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
- The final data was exported to Excel, and interactive visualizations were created to communicate findings.

# Features
- Data Extraction & Cleaning: Extracted data from multiple sources, cleaned it by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data accuracy.
- Data Transformation: Transformed data into a usable format by defining relationships between tables and applying transformations to create a comprehensive data model.
- Data Modeling: Defined relationships between multiple data tables within Power BI to create a robust data model.
- DAX Calculations: Used DAX to create calculated columns and measures, enabling custom calculations and enhancing data insights.
- Excel Data Export: Exported the data of individuals who achieved their targets to Excel for further analysis and sharing.
- Data Visualization: Created interactive visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and cards in Power BI to simplify complex information and make it 
more digestible for non-technical audiences.

# Tools and Technologies
- Power BI: Used for data modeling, visualization, and creating interactive reports.
- Excel: For exporting and sharing specific data (e.g., people who achieved targets).
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for custom calculations and creating measures/columns for enhanced analysis.

# Data Sources
- Monthly quality control reports (Excel/CSV).
